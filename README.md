# SampleApp1
A simple application using NodeJS, AngularJS, Postgres and ExpressJS --> Just to get hang of it ;-)

To run this you will need the following thing:
1-> Download and Install NodeJS (I prefer to keep all my node projects in one single folder)
2-> Install and download expressJS
3->Install and download Postgres -> Create a database named 'sampleapp1' and a table 'namelist' with one field 'name'
4->In the index.js file inside the routes folder, change the passwork and username for Postgres according to your settings. 
5->All set to go now... Open CMD, go to the directory where you have the project, and type 'npm start',
6->Open your browser and type 'localhost:3000' 
Congo if you followed all the steps, the app should be working! :D
